		<h3>Story, because games need that I guess</h3>
		<p>Once upon a time, in the fantastical land of "It's late and I'm too tired to do this"-ia, there lived a majestic king or
		whatever named Khris of the Farnsworths. He gazed out into the kingdom and saw people selecting reasonable tasks for
		the country's annual Daytabasing Projekt. Mad king-or-whatever as he was, Khris elected to muster his strength, and
		assemble a game by pressing a series of buttons a borderline-offensive number of times. The people were confused as
		to why he would willingly subject himself to such a task when easier ones existed. Honestly, I- I MEAN HE - didn't even
		really know. It seemed like a good idea at the time, in a lull between his other perhaps-kingly responsibilities.</p>
		<p>Then he realized he didn't even know what the game was about on April the 24th, in the mighty year of two-thousand,
		two-score, and one or whatever. It was late in the process, is what I'm saying. So, by that point driven mad by the sheer
		volume of code he had written, he wrote basically what happened and called it good enough. I mean, seriously. This game
		allows you to equip magic freaking beans. Are you expecting Moby Dick or something?</p>
		<h3>Erm, this really doesn't look like a game, though</h3>
		<p>That's because if you disguise games as 1990s websites, you can play them in class and it looks like you're working. I am 			totally not making excuses for the fact that the interface was raw HTML until I spent an afternoon googling how exactly CSS 			works again. I would never do that.<p>
		<h3>How to Play</h3>
		<p>Erm, basically just go make a character, equip stuff on them, and then go fight. You'll either win more stuff, or die
		horribly. Probably a little of both. If you'd rather not put in the effort, just do a little dance in your seat or
		something. That's probably equally as fun. Or whatever. Your call.</p>
